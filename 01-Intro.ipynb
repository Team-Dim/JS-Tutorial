    "2. Why do we need computers? Because they can do certain operations (e.g. maths) MUCH quicker than us.\n",
    "3. How do we code? Programming languages are designed for humans to program (give instructions to) a machine. As such, different languages are designed for different use cases.  \n",

    "1. Website app development (3 languages are used: HTML+CSS+JS)\n",
